# Presentations
Welcome to my Presentations repository! This repository contains various presentations on different topics that I have created for conferences, meetups, or personal projects. The presentations are made using tools like PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Markdown for easy viewing and editing.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have a suggestion, or would like to give me some notes on my presentations, feel free to submit a pull request!
